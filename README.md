Hi, I'm Nicholas Eve Mendoza. This portfolio is an overview of my background, training, education, and other details. There's a contact form at the bottom where you can reach me. 
I added some basic interactions like a button to show my education info and a simple form for contacting me. Everything is laid out clearly to keep things simple and easy to use.

Interactions I used in my portfolio

Pop-up Modal for Education Details—When someone clicks the button to view my education info, a pop-up (modal) shows up with educational background. You can click the close button.

Contact Form—If you cannot put name, email, and message fields are not filled out, the contact form will not submit.

Top Button—A "Back to Top" button appears in the lower left corner when you scroll down the page.
