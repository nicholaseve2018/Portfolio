Interactions I used in my portfolio



Pop-up Modal for Education Details—When someone clicks the button to view my education info, a pop-up (modal) shows up with educational background. You can click the close button.

Contact Form—If you cannot put name, email, and message fields are not filled out, the contact form will not submit.

Top Button—A "Back to Top" button appears in the lower left corner when you scroll down the page.
